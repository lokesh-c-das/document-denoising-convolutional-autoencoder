# document_denoising_convolutional_auto_encoder
A convolutional auto-encoder for removing noises from document images. In this project, I created a encoder-decoder model using convolutional neural network (CNN) called Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) that takes a noisy image and reconstructs to the target image removing the noises.
